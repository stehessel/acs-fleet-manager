            value: "1"
        in: query
        name: page
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string
      - description: Number of items in each page
        examples:
          size:
            value: "100"
        in: query
        name: size
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string
      - description: |-
          Specifies the order by criteria. The syntax of this parameter is
          similar to the syntax of the `order by` clause of an SQL statement.
          Each query can be ordered by any of the following `centralRequests` fields:

          * centralUIURL
          * centralDataURL
          * cloud_provider
          * cluster_id
          * created_at
          * href
          * id
          * instance_type
          * multi_az
          * name
          * organisation_id
          * owner
          * region
          * status
          * updated_at
          * version

          For example, to return all Central instances ordered by their name, use the following syntax:

          ```sql
          name asc
          ```

          To return all Central instances ordered by their name _and_ created date, use the following syntax:

          ```sql
          name asc, created_at asc
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then
          the results are ordered by name.
        examples:
          orderBy:
            value: name asc
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: orderBy
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string
        style: form
      - description: |
          Search criteria.

          The syntax of this parameter is similar to the syntax of the `where` clause of an
          SQL statement. Allowed fields in the search are `cloud_provider`, `name`, `owner`, `region`, and `status`. Allowed comparators are `<>`, `=`, or `LIKE`.
          Allowed joins are `AND` and `OR`. However, you can use a maximum of 10 joins in a search query.

          Examples:

          To return a Central instance with the name `my-central` and the region `aws`, use the following syntax:

          ```
          name = my-central and cloud_provider = aws
          ```[p-]

          To return a Central instance with a name that starts with `my`, use the following syntax:

          ```
          name like my%25
          ```

          If the parameter isn't provided, or if the value is empty, then all the Central instances
          that the user has permission to see are returned.

          Note. If the query is invalid, an error is returned.
        examples:
          search:
            value: name = my-central and cloud_provider = aws
        explode: true
        in: query
