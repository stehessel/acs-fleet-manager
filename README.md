### Getting started

#### Prerequisites

* [Golang 1.18+](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - to create database
* [ocm cli](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli/releases) - ocm command line tool
* [Node.js v12.20+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
* IDE with [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) support enabled:
  - there is a [plugin for GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/configuring-code-style.html#editorconfig)
  - there is an [extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
* A running kubernetes cluster

  Supported cluster types:
    * Local: Minikube, Colima, Rancher Desktop, CRC
    * Remote: Infra OpenShift 4.x, OpenShift CI

  Guide: [setup-test-environment.md](./docs/development/setup-test-environment.md#prepare-the-environment)
* Setting up configurations described [here](./docs/development/populating-configuration.md#interacting-with-the-fleet-manager-api)

#### Supported cluster types:
* Local: Minikube, Colima, Rancher Desktop, CRC
* Remote: Infra OpenShift 4.x, OpenShift CI

#### Getting started

To run fleet-manager in different ways (i.e. on a test cluster) please refer to [running-fleet-manager.md](./docs/development/running-fleet-manager.md).

```bash
# Export the kubeconfig path the central instance should be deployed to
$ export KUBECONFIG=/your/kubeconfig

# Bootstrap the environment
$ make deploy/bootstrap

# Sets up database, starts fleet-manager
$ make deploy/dev

# Start fleetshard-sync
$ OCM_TOKEN=$(ocm token --refresh) CLUSTER_ID=1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef ./fleetshard-sync

# To create a central instance
$ ./scripts/create-central.sh

# To interact with the API use
$ ./scripts/fmcurl
```

#### Common make targets

```shell
# Install git-hooks, for more information see git-hooks.md [1]
$ make setup/git/hooks

# To generate code and compile binaries run
$ make all

# To only compile fleet-manager and fleetshard-synchronizer run
$ make binary

# Run API docs server
$ make run/docs

# Generate code such as openapi
$ make generate

# Prepare dev environment for deployment
$ make deploy/bootstrap
# Deploy changes to the test cluster [2]
$ make deploy/dev

# Testing related targets
$ make test
$ make test/e2e
$ make test/integration

# Fleet-manager database related make targets
$ make db/teardown
$ make db/setup
$ make db/migrate
```

#### Background

This project was started from a fleet-manager template with an example "Dinosaur" application as a managed service.
Implementations which reference "Dinosaur" are replaced iteratively.

For a real service written using the same fleet management pattern see the
[kas-fleet-manager](https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/kas-fleet-manager).
Original [fleet-manager template](https://github.com/bf2fc6cc711aee1a0c2a/ffm-fleet-manager-go-template).

To contact the people that created this template go to [zulip](https://bf2.zulipchat.com/).
